# Stockwell Transform
A MATLAB-based tool to compute and visualize the Stockwell Transform (S-Transform) of 1D signals for time-frequency analysis. Ideal for processing network, biomedical, or engineering data.

## Features
- Accepts `.csv` or `.mat` files with a single signal column.
- Automatically normalizes signal.
- Supports custom time vector (or defaults to sample index).
- Outputs a spectrogram using the Stockwell Transform.

## Files
- `apply_stockwell.m`: Main script to apply the Stockwell Transform.
- `stran.m`: MATLAB implementation of the Stockwell Transform.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `instructions.txt`: Step-by-step guide for usage.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018 or later.
- `stran.m` function must be in the same folder.
