# ðŸ“ˆ Stockwell Transform Tool for MATLAB
Generic MATLABÂ / GNUâ€¯Octave utility for computing and visualising Stockwell spectrograms of multiâ€‘channel timeâ€‘series data. The Stockwell Transform is useful in time-frequency analysis, offering high resolution in both domains. This tool is especially helpful for analyzing signals in applications like:

- Cyber-physical systems
- Biomedical signal processing (e.g., EEG, EMG)
- Network traffic analysis
- Mechanical vibrations and audio signals

## ðŸš€ Features
- Flexible input â€” Works on any [channels Ã— samples] matrix.
- Multichannel â€” Handles any number of signal channels.
- Preprocessing â€” Detrend + optional normalisation.
- Event markers â€” Add vertical lines for key timestamps.
- Octave compatible â€” Tested on Octave and MATLAB.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `apply_stockwell.m`: Main script to apply the Stockwell Transform.
- `stran.m`: MATLAB implementation of the Stockwell Transform.

## Requirements
- MATLABÂ R2018aÂ or newer orÂ GNUâ€¯OctaveÂ 6.0+
- `stran.m` function must be in the same folder.
